We're going to want to build up the pitcher/hitter/ID/WB_TEAM table ahead of time and put this into a
CSV.  Then we can save data only for these players.   



database table to build up is:
date, player, game-key, pitcherp, ab, ip, W, SV, QS, DP, ER, H, HR, BB, ASS, SB

logic should be to find the last day in the dB and re-run that day, replacing any entries for any players that day. 

logic of that should match game-key + date & player-id

I should publish the full CSV file of the above, plus then publish the following:

Overall: stats table page:   

longest streak
Team		 W SV QS DP ER H HR BB ASS SB Names

Period Points
Team	  W SV QS DP ER H HR BB ASS SB Names  Total

Make team names clickable:
TeamPage: 


Asterisks are longest active streaks:

Player:				  W S   w*   s*
Pitching Staff:

Player:					  HR SB hr*  sb*
Batting Staff:

Pitcher:				  QS ER=0 DP   qs* er*  dp*

Batter:							   H BB ASS h* bb* ass*


Then, the team stats are longest streaks of HR/SB/W/SV by team, individual stats are the others, summed for longest streak
